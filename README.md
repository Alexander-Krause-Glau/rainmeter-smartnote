# rainmeter-smartnote
Totally based on [Tobliug's SmartNote skin](https://tobliug.deviantart.com/art/SmartNote-1-0-492161237) for Rainmeter, all the credit is due to him. Code is only extended by a dead simple export button, that copies all notes to your clipboard. Great for sharing your sweet notes with your colleagues.
